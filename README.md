## Features

Recursive task decomposition for complex reasoning.

Integration with web search (using Serper or Exa API).

Verification step to ensure high-quality outputs.

Deployable as a REST API for web access or integration (e.g., into a Discord bot).


## Tech Stack

ROMA framework (Python, DSPy).

LLMs via OpenRouter (free tier available).
